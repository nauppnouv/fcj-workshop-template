During the third week (September 28–October 2, 2026), I studied VPC connectivity and EC2, and attended the AWS Cloud and AI Day Hanoi watch party in Ho Chi Minh City on September 29. I moved the Transit Gateway and compute topics around the event day, with AWS Backup scheduled for the start of Week 4.

### Week 3 objectives

- Configure VPC Peering and understand the routing, security, and DNS conditions for connectivity between two VPCs.
- Study Transit Gateway attachments, association, propagation, and the relationship between VPC and TGW route tables.
- Understand EC2 instance selection, AMIs, key pairs, snapshots, EBS, and instance store.
- Study User Data, instance metadata, EC2 Auto Scaling, and the roles of EFS, FSx, Lightsail, and AWS MGN.
- Attend the AWS Cloud and AI Day Hanoi watch party and connect the keynote topics to cloud engineering and software validation.

### Week 3 achievements

- Completed 24 course videos and used the AWS EC2 instance types documentation to supplement a video without a transcript; attended the watch party on September 29.
- Configured VPC Peering in the lab and identified the conditions required for connectivity between two VPCs, including non-overlapping CIDRs, routes on both sides, and suitable security rules.
- Built a multi-VPC Transit Gateway lab and distinguished VPC routes from TGW routes, including the roles of attachments, association, and propagation.
- Consolidated EC2 instance selection criteria and compared EBS and instance store data persistence across instance lifecycle actions.
- Distinguished User Data from instance metadata and reviewed the roles of Auto Scaling, EFS, FSx, Lightsail, and MGN.
- Connected the watch party keynote themes to practical cloud engineering, access governance, evidence-based software validation, and human responsibility.

### Lessons learned

- I learned that an active VPC Peering connection alone does not ensure application connectivity. I need to check CIDRs, routes on both sides, Security Groups, Network ACLs, and name resolution along the traffic path.
- I distinguished VPC route tables from TGW route tables. Association selects the TGW route table used for traffic arriving from an attachment, while propagation adds that attachment's routes to the selected table.
- Reachability Analyzer helps me assess reachability based on network configuration; its result does not replace testing a running application connection.
- I learned that choosing EBS or instance store depends on performance and data-retention needs. Instance store is suited to temporary data, while data that must persist needs appropriate durable storage and lifecycle settings.
- I learned how AMIs and User Data support consistent instance initialization, while metadata provides instance information for operational processes. These concepts help me understand Auto Scaling designs.
- From the watch party, I took away that AI-assisted development needs appropriate access controls, test evidence, and accountable human review. Faster delivery still depends on reliable engineering foundations and validation.

### Next step

In Week 4, I will begin with the AWS Backup and restore lab on October 5, then continue with S3, CloudFront, and the next storage topics in the learning path.
