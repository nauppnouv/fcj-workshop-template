During the second week (September 21–25, 2026), I studied AWS networking and worked with VPC, EC2, and Route 53 Resolver. I recorded the work by day, moving from network fundamentals to Hybrid DNS testing and resource cleanup.

### Week 2 objectives

- Understand how VPCs, CIDRs, subnets, and route tables are organized, and trace network traffic paths.
- Distinguish Security Groups from Network ACLs and consider both outbound and return traffic when checking connectivity.
- Build a public/private subnet environment, connect EC2 instances, and learn to manage private instances through an EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint.
- Compare VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, Site-to-Site VPN, Direct Connect, and load balancers at an architecture-selection level.
- Configure Hybrid DNS components with Route 53 Resolver and test domain-name resolution.
- Identify CloudFormation ownership boundaries and clean up resources according to their dependencies.

### Week 2 achievements

- Completed 31 Module 02, Lab03, and Lab10 videos; organized the material across five study days and connected concepts with the lab environments.
- Distinguished VPCs, subnets, route tables, IGW, NAT Gateway, Security Groups, and Network ACLs; understood how these components work together to route or control traffic.
- Configured a sample VPC with public/private subnets, EC2 instances, required routes, and tested the main connectivity paths in the lab.
- Learned to use an EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint to reach a private EC2 instance through its private IP, while recognizing that IAM, security groups, and routing still affect access.
- Configured Route 53 Resolver components for the Hybrid DNS lab and tested resolution for the simulated `onprem.example.com` domain.
- Cleaned up resources according to ownership: handling separately created components and resources managed by the CloudFormation stack.

### Lessons learned

- I learned to trace the full traffic path when analyzing connectivity: address and subnet, route table, network interface, security group, NACL, and destination service. A suitable route alone does not prove that a connection will succeed.
- I distinguished stateful Security Groups from stateless Network ACLs. When using a NACL, I need to consider rules for both outbound and return traffic, as well as rule evaluation order.
- I learned that public/private describes a subnet's routing, while an EC2 instance's public IP is a separate factor. I also concluded that CIDRs should be planned early to reduce conflicts when connecting networks; AWS allows secondary CIDRs to be associated under supported conditions.
- EICE helped me understand one way to manage a private EC2 instance through its private IP without assigning a public IP to the target. IAM permissions, security groups, and routing still need to be configured appropriately.
- I distinguished the query direction of Route 53 inbound and outbound endpoints. A successful query confirms only the path tested; each direction and application reachability need separate checks when the scope requires them.
- I learned that cleanup is part of the lab process. Before deleting resources, I need to identify which are managed by the stack and which were created separately, then handle them according to their dependencies.

### Next step

In Week 3, I will move on to Multi-VPC, VPC Peering, and Transit Gateway, and study how to deploy and connect EC2 instances in a multi-network architecture.
